# WC3 data extraction and analysis 

### Overview

This project fixes a broken rating system used on the w3a and Bnet servers by retroactively implimenting a modified Elo rating system. The resulting Elo-based system assigns ratings that are relatively insensitive to the skill of one's opponents (unlike win percentage, for example) and provides a useful basis for matchmaking in online play.

For discussion of the problems with w3a rating system, see [this thread][1].

For an introduction to the Elo system, see its [wiki][2].


### Results and application
Up-to-date player ratings for the w3a server can be found on this [spreadsheet][3].

For results and applications of earlier versions of this code, see tmahlstrom's posts on the following topics: 
* Recalculated player ratings using the Elo system. [Link][4]
* Comparison of Elo ratings and player win percentage. [Link][5]
* Elo history of individual player accounts. [Link][6]
* Elo-based comparison of the different races in WC3. [Link][7]
